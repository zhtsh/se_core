KENZ (FM)

KENZ (94.9 FM, "The Vibe") is a classic hip hop radio station broadcasting to Salt Lake City, Utah and the surrounding areas. It is owned and operated by Cumulus Media. The station's studios are located in South Salt Lake (behind the I-15/I-80 interchange) and its transmitter site is located on Lake Mountain.

The station and frequency was previously owned and operated by Millcreek Broadcasting. In early summer 2008, the station was acquired by Citadel Broadcasting. Millcreek Broadcasting moved "The Blaze" to a new frequency, KZZQ 97.5 FM (Coalville) and KAUU 105.1 FM (Manti). As a result of the purchase of 94.9, Citadel divested KKAT-FM to Wasatch Radio, LLC as Trustee due to ownership limitations. Citadel did not acquire the intellectual property rights to maintain the former station slogan "The Blaze", and this resulted in the previous name "94.9 Z-ROCK" (which was previously "94.9 ROCKS").

Starting in 1981, the station was known as KLRZ. While with those call letters, the station carried an adult contemporary format, which later flipped to CHR as KBNG. As KTOU ("The Touch") the station carried a new age format. The format lasted a few years before the station became KZHT, and the format changed to rock.

The station, as KZHT, was popular among teens along the Wasatch Front. KZHT moved up the dial to 97.1 FM in 2004 and maintained the top 40 format, while KHTB became an active rock station which became known better as "The Blaze". The reason for the move was primarily based on signal. The 94.9 transmitter is located on Lake Mountain south of Salt Lake, and west of Provo, while 97.1's transmitter is located on Farnsworth Peak. The station was quite popular through most of its run and then in August 2008, Citadel acquired the frequency and "The Blaze" moved to 97.5 which was then the defunct KOAY. KHTB then became known as 94.9 Z-Rock, an active rock station going up against KXRK. Sister station KBER moved to classic rock at the same time. Citadel merged with Cumulus Media on September 16, 2011.
On September 2, 2013, KHTB shifted to an alternative rock format, branded as "ALT 94.9". 
The station boasts a number of personalities. Howie Rock, Corky, and Lindsay the Traffic Girl lead off with The Rock Show from 6-10am local time, followed by Monroe from 2-7pm. Flapjack does nights and Melissa Snow does Saturday afternoons.
On September 4, 2015, 94.9 began simulcasting on KENZ as part of a format transfer. 94.9 and 101.9 simulcasted for the weekend, while directing listeners to the latter frequency. On September 8, 2015, at 5 PM, KHTB ended the simulcast with KENZ and switched to a classic hip hop format, branded as "94.9 The Vibe". On September 23, 2015, KHTB changed their call letters to KENZ.
